Project Overview

This project aims to analyze player performances from the T20 World Cup 2022 and determine the best possible XI for the tournament. By leveraging data analytics tools like Python, Pandas, and Power BI, we meticulously assessed various performance metrics to build a comprehensive dashboard. The dashboard categorizes players into different roles such as openers, middle-order anchors, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers, and finally, compiles a best XI team.

Data Collection

Source: The dataset was compiled from ESPNcricinfo and GitHub repositories.
Contents: The data includes player statistics such as runs, strike rates, averages, wickets, economy rates, and other relevant performance indicators from the T20 World Cup 2022.

Data Processing

Tools Used: Python and Pandas were employed for data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation.
Steps:
Data was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or missing values.
Performance metrics were calculated and normalized where necessary to ensure fair comparisons.
Players were classified into roles based on their performance data and match contributions.

Dashboard & Analysis

Power BI: The cleaned and processed data was imported into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.
Sections:
Openers: Analysis of the best-performing opening batsmen based on runs scored, strike rate, and consistency.
Anchors/Middle Order: Evaluation of middle-order batsmen who provided stability and key contributions.
All-Rounders: Comprehensive review of players excelling with both bat and ball.
Specialist Fast Bowlers: Identification of the most effective fast bowlers based on wickets taken, economy rate, and strike rate.
Final 11 Team: The culmination of the analysis, presenting the best possible XI team that could have represented the T20 World Cup 2022.

How to Use the Dashboard

The dashboard allows users to interactively explore different player categories and their contributions.
Filters are available to adjust the criteria for player selection, enabling a customized view of the best XI team.

Conclusion

This project not only showcases the best XI team based on data-driven insights but also demonstrates the power of data analytics in sports. It provides a valuable tool for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and coaches to evaluate player performances and make informed decisions.
